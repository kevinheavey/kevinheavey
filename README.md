I made AnchorPy and I also work on solana-py.

If you make money using stuff I made, feel free to send funds to this Solana address: `8d14UuFobedcyXwAEMAhmpADq6kH2pJQvXMBg9JLZH9A`.

This will make you my friend and also make me work more on these open source tools.

If you lose money using stuff I made you can also send me funds. It's open to everyone.
