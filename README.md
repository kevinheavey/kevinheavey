I made AnchorPy and I also work on solana-py.

If you make money using stuff I made, feel free to send funds to this Solana address Fnhi3quR4j2gG3YJaNiUta6pyruVbTkrzdvSGhSF2ehd. This will make you my friend and also make me work more on these open source tools.

If you lose money using stuff I made you can also send me funds. It's open to everyone.
